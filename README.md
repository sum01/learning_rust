# Learning Rust

This is just a repo to hold all my beginner projects for teaching myself Rust.

Coming into Rust, my experience was limited to the basics of a few languages, nothing in-depth.

The goal of this is to get comfortable with Rust.

## Building

Dependencies: `rustc` (the Rust compiler) and `cargo`. Use `cargo run` from the root dir of the desired project.
